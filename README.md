Hi 👋 I’m Alex Domingues Batista

I’m a PhD-trained scientist transitioning into **Applied Data Science**, with strong experience working with **sensor/measurement data**, data quality, validation, and statistical analysis. I’m currently completing a **full-time Data Science Bootcamp (WBS Coding School)** (expected completion: Mar 2026).

### What I work on
- **Time-series & sensor data**: noise, drift, variability, monitoring insights
- **Statistical analysis & experimentation**: hypothesis testing, validation mindset
- **Applied ML (practical & interpretable)**: baseline models, clustering, anomaly-style analyses

### Featured projects
- **Time-Series Sensor Data Analysis (NASA Turbofan)** 
  - data quality & drift analysis, rolling features, baseline monitoring models
- **Retail Customer Segmentation (RFM + K-Means)**
  - validated segmentation, stability tests, actionable business playbook

### Tech
Python (pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn) • SQL • Jupyter • Git/GitHub • matplotlib/seaborn • Tableau (basic)

### Open to
Applied Data Scientist / Data Analyst roles involving **real-world data** (sensor, experimental, operational) and cross-functional collaboration.
